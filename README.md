# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To discover if the launch date and starting goal amount affects whether or not a kickstarter campaign for a play is successful. The dataset analyzed to test this hypothesis was 1369 play kickstarter campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The month with the most successful campaigns is May with 111, June follows not far behind with 100. No month seemed to have a significant amount of failures.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the graph, it appears as the budget increases, the chances of a campaign being successful decreases. The range with the most successful projects is 1000-4999, but that is also the range with the most failures. However, as a whole, successful projects make up 73% of the total projects in that range so the amount of failures don't hold that much weight. Unlike projects with a budget over 50,000. These projects seem way more likely to fail with 14 failures out of 16 projects in that group.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No difficulties were encountered. There could have been several major outliers that made no sense and could have really skewed the data, however, that did not seem to be the case here.

## Results

Based on the results of my analysis, it can be concluded that in order to have a successful kickstarter campaign for a play, the launch date should be late spring or early summer and the target goal should ideally be no greater than $5000. Possible other factors that may affect the success rate are the country, the year, and even the number of backers. Some limitations include not having a decent amount of data on projects with higher budgets, as well as, having no data on cancelled play projects.
